## Hello! I'm Andrew Hennessy, a data scientist with a passion for Ecology and the Environment.
This page has a condensed resume and a portfolio of my projects, visualizations, and presentations.

### Resume
Graduated from Wesleyan University with a 3.76 GPA double majoring in Biology and Earth & Environmental Sciences along with a minor in Data Analysis.

I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Biology at Wesleyan where I am continuing research that I started during my undergraduate career in the <a href="http://msinger.faculty.wesleyan.edu/"> Singer Lab </a> and plan to graduate in the Spring of 2022.

While at Wesleyan I worked as a GIS Research Assistant under <a href = "https://jenniferraynor.wordpress.com/"> Jennifer Raynor Ph.D. </a> where I worked on multiple projects involving the environment and economic policies through geospatial analysis. 


Programming Skills: <b>Expert:</b> in R and ArcGIS <b>Proficient:</b> in Stata, Python, SQL, and HTML

### Portfolio
#### Projects

##### messy.cats
I co-authored an R package (currently in review to be added to CRAN) that helps clean messy categorical data. This package has multiple functions that use a reference vector of clean names, and a vector of messy names, calculates the string distance between each messy name and the clean names and returns the closest match for each messy name found in the clean vector.  <a href = "https://hkarp1.github.io/messy.cats/"> messy.cats </a>

##### E&ES Senior Seminar
As a capstone senior project for the Earth & Environmental Science major I helped to establish an unused plot of forested land owned by Wesleyan University as a long term experimental research forest. I randomly distributed eight plots across the forest's area, led a field team to measure the diameter of all trees in the plots, take soil samples, and calculate the total amount of carbon stored in this forest. The goal of this project was to asses the viability of this plot as a carbon offset for the travel emissions of Wesleyan University and provide space for future students to implement research projects. <a href = "Long Lane Research Forest.pdf" target="_blank"> Wesleyan University Long Lane Research Forest </a>

##### Wolf Recolonization
I digitized, visualized, and analyzed wolf ranges in multiple western states to analyze the effect wolf presence and density has on deer vehicle collisions and the economic impact of wolves in these states. I also created R-scripts to automate the extraction of wolf presence and density across the counties in these states across 35+ years of wolf survey data. In my Advanced GIS course I created a framework for a geographically weighted regression analysis to measure the impact these wolves had on the spread of Chronic Wasting Disease in deer, but we are waiting on data to be released by the FWS. 

##### Master's Thesis

#### Visualizations

I created a <a href = "datavis_Shiny_app.R"> shiny application </a> that uses <a href = "https://www.gbif.org/dataset/aea17af8-5578-4b04-b5d3-7adf0c5a1e60"> data </a> from the Norweigian Institute for Nature Research that sampled just under 4,000,000 occurences of butterfly and bumblebee pollinators from 2009 - 2020. I used Shiny in R in combination with interactive graphs, Leaflet, and ggplotly maps to allow users to explore the diversity and species distribution of pollinators across Norway.
